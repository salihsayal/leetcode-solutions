# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository for **LeetCode** challenges! Here you'll find my solutions to various challenges I've completed on the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) platform.

## About LeetCode

**LeetCode** provides coding and algorithmic problems intended for users to practice coding.

## Repository Structure

Each solution is organized into its own directory, named after the specific challenge. Inside each directory, you will typically find:

```
Challenge-name/
├── README.md (solution details)
└── challenge-name.cpp/py
```

## Solutions 

Here is a list of my completed challenges with links to each solution: 
| # | Title | Used |
|---| ----- | -------- |
|1|[Two Sums](./two-sum/| C++ |

> **Note**: Each solution contains its own `README.md` file with more details, such as implementation notes, technologies used, and any optimizations made.

## Installation
